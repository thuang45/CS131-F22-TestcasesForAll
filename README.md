# CS 131 - Brewin Project Testcase Crowd-Sourcing

Hello! This is a fork from the official CS 131 autograder repository, with some additional testcases. Feel free to just use it -- but I ***strongly*** encourage that you create a pull request and provide your own testcases to the repository. 

## News & Updates

- (11/8) Added testcases from Qianli. Note: testcase #462 is ambiguous and will not be tested (according to TA), so it has been removed. 
- (11/7) Some V2 testcases were added by Tina and Evan! Yours truly also added some of their own. :D
- (10/28) Now up to date with upstream repo, supporting V2 testing! Contribute your testcases now for... idk, good karma :)
- (10/23) Thanks to the effort of Brandon, Qingyang, Tina, Evan, Yiyang (and myself maybe), we now have 50 testcases for V1! 

## Usage

Note: the following instructions are adapted from the official repo.

- First, clone this repository and make it your working directory:

```sh
$ git clone
# or, with SSH
$ git clone git@github.com:UCLA-CS-131/fall-22-autograder.git
...
cd fall-22-autograder
```

### Running Brewin Scripts

- To run the Brewin (V1) interpreter with a given file, use `./brewin.sh <FILE>`. 
- To run the Brewin++ (V2) interpreter with a given file, use `./brewin++.sh <FILE>`. 

### Local Auto-testing

- To test locally, you will additionally need a **working implementation** of the project; the minimum example is an `interpreterv1.py` that implements the `Interpreter` class. Place this in the same directory as `tester.py`; or alternatively, link it (and other supporting files) to this directory:

```sh
ln -s <PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR>/interpreterv1.py interpreterv1.py
```

- Then to test project 1, simply run `python3 tester.py 1`. Similarly, you can test other versions with `python3 tester.py <VER>`. 

Note: we also output the results of the terminal output to `results.json`.
